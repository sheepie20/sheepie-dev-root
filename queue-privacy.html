  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: July 8, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Simple Queues ("the Bot") collects, stores, and uses information on Discord servers where it is installed.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>The Bot stores only the minimal data required for functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Server (guild) IDs and related configuration settings</li>
    <li>Channel, category, and role IDs associated with the queueing and session system</li>
    <li>Queueing history, including when users join or leave the queue</li>
    <li>Information needed to manage and create temporary session voice channels</li>
    <li>Logging targets (such as log channel ID)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>No message content, usernames, or personally identifiable information (PII) is stored.</strong></p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>The stored data is used only to support the bot's features, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically managing queueing behavior</li>
    <li>Creating and removing temporary session voice channels</li>
    <li>Moving users between channels when conditions are met</li>
    <li>Logging queue events and setup activity to specified channels</li>
    <li>Allowing administrators to configure the system via commands</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally in an SQLite database file (`queueing_system.db`) on the server where the bot is hosted. No data is shared with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Standard security practices are followed to protect the database and its contents. However, no system can be guaranteed completely secure.</p>

  <h2>5. User Controls</h2>
  <p>Server administrators may use the `/reset-settings` command at any time to erase all data associated with their server, including configuration and logs.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact <a href="mailto:sheepiegamer20@gmail.com">sheepiegamer20@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p>This policy may be updated without prior notice. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
